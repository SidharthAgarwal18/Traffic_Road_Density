# COP290
This program estimates the queue and dynamic density of a traffic on a road.
* `subtask1` contains the code for camera correction and frame cropping in OpenCV.
* `subtask2` contains the code for estimating density using simple backgorund subtraction after camera adjustment.
* `subtask3` analyses runtime-utility tradeoff by changing resolution, splitting work spatially and temporally using multi-threading.
